Random number generator analysis.

General info about the assignment1: 

This assignment is a simple Java-application, developed within the course of OOAD.
Its goal is to show the basics of object-oriented approach and work with various built-in tools for generating random numbers in Java.
The program creates random values in the interval [0, 1), performs their analysis and displays the results in tabular form

Generators thats used:                                              
The project uses the following standard Java generators:
                                                   
- java.util.Random
- Math.random()
- java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom               
Each of them is checked on samples of different sizes

Computable values:
For each generated sample are calculated:
                                                   
- number of elements (n)
- mean
- sample standard deviation
- minimum value
- maximum value
                                                   
As the data volume increases, the results tend to theoretically expected values (average 0.5, standard deviation 0.29)
